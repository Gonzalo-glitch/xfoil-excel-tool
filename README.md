# XFOIL-inspired Excel Tool (Aerodynamics)

## Overview
This repository contains an Excel-based tool inspired by **XFOIL** (NASA) to explore basic airfoil aerodynamics.
It was built as an academic/personal project to practice aerodynamics modeling, structured calculation workflows, and result validation.

## What it does
- Runs an airfoil analysis workflow in **Excel**.
- Produces aerodynamic outputs (e.g., lift/drag-related results) and summary tables/plots.
- Includes additional outputs compared to the reference tool.

## Screenshots
A quick visual overview is available here:
- `docs/images/README.md`

## Notes on validation
Results were checked against the reference tool to confirm consistent trends and reasonable values.

## Files
- `/docs/images/` — screenshots and figures
- Excel file:
  - `/tool/Metodo_de_paneles.xlsx`
