# Aerodynamics Tools in Excel (XFOIL-inspired + Glauert/NACA)

## Overview
This repository contains two Excel-based aerodynamics tools developed as personal/academic projects:
1) An **XFOIL-inspired workflow in Excel**, organized with a panel-based interface.
2) An Excel tool that computes **Glauert coefficients** for **NACA airfoils**.

Screenshots and figures are available in `docs/images/README.md`.

## Tools
### 1) XFOIL-inspired Excel Tool
- File: `tool/Metodo_de_paneles.xlsx`
- Purpose: run an airfoil analysis workflow in Excel with a panel-based layout for inputs/outputs.
- Outputs: aerodynamic coefficients and summary tables/plots (see screenshots).

### 2) Glauert Coefficients for NACA Airfoils
- File: `tool/Coeficientes de Glauert_NACA.xlsx`
- Purpose: compute Glauert coefficients for a given NACA airfoil definition.
- Inputs: NACA designation / airfoil parameters
- Outputs: coefficient set for the selected airfoil.

## Notes
- These are educational tools intended to demonstrate structured engineering workflows and result handling in Excel.
- Public version: screenshots + files are shared for portfolio purposes.
